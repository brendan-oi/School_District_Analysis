# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
This project asks us to examine the performance and other data for a school district concerned that the ninth grade reading and math scores for a specific school may have been altered. Replacing this suspect data with NaNs and re-running the analysis allows us to provide the board with insight undistorted by academic dishonesty. Among the information we examined was:

* The average scores, passing rates and school statistics for the district and for each school
* The top and bottom five performing schools by pass rate
* The average math and reading scores for each grade at each school
* Spending per student and by school size and type

## Summary

Omitting the compromised data did lower the average scores and passing rates on a district level, but by small amounts, less than a percent in each case. 

Naturally, for Thomas Highschool specifically, the changes were more impactful, but THS was not moved in the school ranking.

Other school categories were affected, with charter schools, medium sized schools and schools in the $631 - $645 per student spending bin seeing their reading rate, math scores and math passing rate, and over all passing rate decreased.
