# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
This project asks us to examine the performance and other data for a school district concerned that the ninth grade reading and math scores for a specific school may have been altered. Replacing this suspect data with NaNs and re-running the analysis allows us to provide the board with insight undistorted by academic dishonesty. Among the information we examined was:

* The average scores, passing rates and school statistics for the district and for each school
* The top and bottom five performing schools by pass rate
* The average math and reading scores for each grade at each school
* Spending per student and by school size and type
