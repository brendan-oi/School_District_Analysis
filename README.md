# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
This project asks us to examine the performance and other data for a school district concerned that the ninth grade reading and math scores for a specific school may have been altered. Replacing this suspect data with NaNs and re-running the analysis allows us to provide the board with insight undistorted by academic dishonesty.
